Bash Stuff
===========

A miscellaneous of bash stuff - including `oh-my-zsh` theme and aliases

It's a personal and only-for-funny project! So don't take it too seriously, but feel free to send any requests you want ;)

Let's enjoy it. Not judge it, because i dont give a freaking shit...

While it's in --alpha version and to this work fine have some steps:
 * Clone repository in ~/lab/
 * Copy theme file to oh-my-zsh themes directory `mv tuntz.zash-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/tuntz.zash-theme`
